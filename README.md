# INCA

Welcome to the INCA Project
The Knowledge Innovation Project on an Integrated system of Natural Capital and ecosystem services Accounting (KIP INCA) is developing a set of experimental accounts at EU level. JRC develops the ecosystem services accounts.

The components of ecosystem services assessed are ecosystem service potential (the amount of service ecosystems can provide in a sustainable way), ecosystem service demand (the need for a specific ecosystem service by the society), and service use (the service flow that is actually mobilized contributing to the different components of the human well-being). The actual flow of the service is reported in the accounting tables.
